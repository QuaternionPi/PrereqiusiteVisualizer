# PrerequisiteVisualizer
I build the Prerequisite Visualizer to dynamically draw a graph of courses and their prerequisites. It exists to help make navigating the complex web of course prerequisites at my university easier.

It needs an update to the user interface to make it less industrial and more user friendly.
